# Daily-Expense-Tracker
The Daily Expense Tracker is a practical and user-friendly tool designed to help users manage their
finances efficiently. The project allows users to log daily expenses, categorize them (e.g., food, travel, utilities), and view summarized reports for specific time periods such as a day, week, or month. The
application also stores all data in a text file, ensuring that users can retrieve and review their expense history
at any time. 

Key Features of the Project
1. Add Expenses: Users can log expenses by specifying the amount, category, and a short description.
2. View Summaries: The application can display:
   - Total expenses for the day.
   - Total expenses for the week.
   - Total expenses for the month.
3. Save Data: All expense records are stored in a text file for future reference.
